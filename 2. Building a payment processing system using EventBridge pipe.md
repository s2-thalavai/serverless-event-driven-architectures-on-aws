# Building a payment processing system using EventBridge pipe

In this Cloud Lab, you’ll explore how to design a serverless, event-driven payment architecture on AWS. 
Using EventBridge, Lambda, DynamoDB, and SNS, you’ll implement real-time transaction processing, data enrichment, and instant payment notifications.

## Amazon EventBridge
- Amazon EventBridge is an event management service.
- It allows you to connect components of a loosely coupled application through events, sparing developers the hassle of writing code to trigger or invoke components. 
- EventBridge routes, filters, and processes events among AWS services, SaaS applications, and custom applications.
- EventBridge Pipes support point-to-point integration by connecting a source and a target.
- Pipes allow you to filter and enrich the events sent to the destination.
