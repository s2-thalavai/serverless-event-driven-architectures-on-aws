# Event-driven architecture

- Event-driven architecture (EDA) in AWS is a design pattern in which components communicate through events. 
- This allows systems to be loosely coupled, scalable, and reactive. 
- EDA enables services to respond automatically to state changes, promoting asynchronous workflows and improving modularity and flexibility in application design.
